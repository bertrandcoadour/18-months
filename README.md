# 18-months

[Deployed Link](https://18-months.vercel.app/)

Visualize my 18-month adventure through sports activities! This project aggregates and displays hiking, running and cycling data from my Garmin account, offering a different perspective on my travels from March 2023 to August 2024.

## About 18-months

I traveled for one and a half years around the world, between March 2023 and August 2024.
I visitied numerous countries by various means of transportation. In all of them, I hiked and ran a lot.

As a software engineer with 7 years of experience and a passion for web development, I looked for a personal project to enhance my skills.

That's how I got the idea of 18-months : download all my sport activities, stored on my Garmin account, and create a nice app
to vizualize them, compare them, filter them...

Starting late December 2024, I proudly deployed the first version of 18-months by the end of March 20225.
I will still be working on it in the next following months !
